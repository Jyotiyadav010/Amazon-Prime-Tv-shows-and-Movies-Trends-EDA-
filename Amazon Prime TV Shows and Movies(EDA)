The primary objective of this analysis is to understand factors that influence customer engagement and churn, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve content offerings and user retention.\n","\n","The dataset used in this project consists of two key files: titles, which includes information about movies and TV shows such as content type, release year, genres, runtime, age certification, IMDb and TMDB scores, and production countries; and credits, which contains details about cast and crew including actors and directors. Data wrangling techniques were applied to handle missing values, remove inconsistencies, correct data types, and merge datasets where necessary to ensure reliable analysis.\n","\n","The EDA involved univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using visualizations such as count plots, bar charts, line plots, box plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps. Key insights were derived related to content distribution between movies and TV shows, dominant genres, year-wise content growth, age certification patterns, runtime variation across genres, regional content availability, and the contribution of directors and production countries. Rating analysis using IMDb and TMDB scores helped assess overall content quality and audience perception.\n","\n","The analysis revealed that Amazon Prime’s content library is movie-centric, with strong emphasis on popular genres such as Drama, Comedy, and Action. Most content falls within the average-to-good rating range, highlighting consistency but also revealing opportunities to invest in more premium, high-rated content. Regional analysis showed that content availability and quality are concentrated in a few major production countries, suggesting potential for geographical diversification. Additionally, insights from correlation analysis confirmed the alignment between different rating platforms and popularity indicators.\n","\n","Overall, this project demonstrates how EDA can be effectively used to uncover meaningful patterns and insights from raw data. The findings can support Amazon Prime in optimizing content acquisition, improving recommendation systems, enhancing viewer satisfaction, and ultimately reducing customer churn through better content strategy and audience-focused decisions."],"metadata":{"id":"ifRmyZmWGoB9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link-**"],"metadata":{"id":"L7qVZiA7Gzkc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["https://github.com/Jyotiyadav010/Amazon-Prime-Tv-shows-and-Movies-Trends-EDA-"],"metadata":{"id":"vSBIDR7HHAIZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Amazon Prime faces customer churn due to lack of engaging, diverse, and high-quality content.
